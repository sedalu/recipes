# Macaroni & Cheese

Yield: 4 to 6 servings

I am unsure of these proportions, and will test.

## Ingredients

- 1 pound brick of extra sharp cheddar cheese (shred or into small cubes)
- 1 pounds of dry macaroni (apr 4 cups)
- 4 cups whole milk
- 8 Tbsp of flour
- 8 Tbsp of butter
- salt and pepper

## Directions

1. Mix four and shortening together to make a paste.
2. Heat milk over medium heat, stirring in paste to melt as the milk gets lukewarm.
3. Constantly stir the milk mixture, it will thicken as it gets warmer. Do not let boil.
4. Once the milk mixture is thick add cheese to melt and add salt and pepper to taste.
5. Cook pasta per package directions, drain and combine with cheese sauce. Serve immediately.
